My name is Hisham Baobaid, and I am currently a second-year undergraduate at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), focusing on obtaining my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.  
  
I love volunteering and giving back to my community. In the past, I have worked with the [CSE Department at UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) and tutored for CSE 11, a class with hundreds of students. As a tutor, I would walk through programming assignments with students and point them in the right direction.  
  
When it comes to CSE I have experience in multiple programming languages such as Java, C, C++, and ARM Assembly. I intend to further my knowledge in not just programming but in other departments of STEM as well.

## <a name="where-it-all-started"></a> ***Where It All Started?***
My passion for computer science and engineering started around middle school. I had joined a Robotics class I thought robots were intriguing and wanted to learn more about them. Turns out, we made our built our own robot and even had a competition for who could complete the obstacle course the fastest. This class has taught me what it would be like to be an engineer because we would practice skills that an engineer would practice. These consist of:  
* Design and Plan
* Group Meetings
* Research
* Implementation
* Testing
* Debugging
* Maintenance  

As we were working on this year-long project, I specifically remember that I enjoyed coding up the robot the most, because it was my code that made the robot move around and perform certain actions. Building the robot was also a fun task because it reminded me of playing with legos which was a hobby I had as a kid.  

Despite our hard work and time put into this project, it was not enough for my team to win the competition. This helped me realize that it is okay to fail. It might not feel the best, but failure is inevitable. 

Even though we failed, I am still proud of what we accomplished:
